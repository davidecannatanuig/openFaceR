*Methods for using OpenFace in R*

This project aims to build and evaluate functions for helping social scientists in using OpenFace. The functions make extensive use of the *tidyverse* package.

[OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace) is a state-of-the art tool intended for facial landmark detection, head pose estimation,  
facial action unit recognition, and eye-gaze estimation.  
 
This project has been created by Davide Cannata as part of his PhD at *National University of Ireland Galway*.  
The research is funded by the *Irish Research Council*.
